# Documentation Changes

When working on documentation changes that affect visual presentation or layout, **always use Playwright** to display and capture visual changes. This helps reviewers understand the impact of documentation modifications.

## Writing Style Guidelines

**Keep documentation concise and code-focused:**
- Prefer code examples over verbose explanations
- Keep document files focused and concise for readability
- Use clear, simple language that's easy to understand
- Show working examples first, explain details second
- Remove unnecessary words - every sentence should add value
- Write the answer as 2–4 cohesive paragraphs. No bullet points, no numbered lists, no sub-headings, no tables, no Markdown lists.

## Running the Documentation Locally

The project uses [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) for documentation. Use the following commands:

- **Build the docs**: `just docs-build` - Builds the documentation to `docs/book/`
- **Serve with auto-reload**: `just docs-watch` - Serves the docs at `http://localhost:3000` with live reload
- **Serve and open browser**: `just docs-serve` - Serves the docs and automatically opens in your browser

Alternatively, you can use mdbook directly:
```bash
cd docs
mdbook serve        # Serve with live reload
mdbook build        # Build static HTML
```

### Important: Local vs. Production URL Structure

The documentation uses a multi-version setup for production deployment on GitHub Pages, but `mdbook serve` doesn't support this structure locally.

**Local development** (with `mdbook serve`):
- Navigate directly to `http://localhost:3000/overview.html` or any specific page
- The version picker dropdown will not work locally (it's designed for the multi-version production site)
- Root `http://localhost:3000/` may show a redirect page - this is expected

**Production** (GitHub Pages):
- Full URL: `https://microsoft.github.io/wassette/latest/overview.html`
- Root redirect: `https://microsoft.github.io/wassette/` → `https://microsoft.github.io/wassette/latest/`
- Version picker works correctly across `/latest/`, `/v0.3.0/`, etc.

## Using Playwright for Documentation

- Use `playwright-browser_navigate` to load the documentation page
- Use `playwright-browser_take_screenshot` to capture the visual state before and after changes
- Compare screenshots to highlight differences in layout, formatting, or content presentation
- Include screenshots in your progress reports to show visual impact

This ensures that documentation changes are properly validated and reviewers can see the actual visual impact of the modifications.
