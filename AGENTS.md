# AI Agent Development Guide for Wassette

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for AI agents (including GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, and others) working on the Wassette project.

## Project Overview

Wassette is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** implementation that runs Tools as **WebAssembly (Wasm) components** using the Wasmtime engine. It provides a security-oriented runtime that enables AI agents to execute tools with browser-grade isolation.

### Key Features
- **Convenience**: Easy extension of AI agents with new tools via MCP
- **Reusability**: Generic Wasm Components with no MCP-specific dependencies
- **Security**: Built on Wasmtime security sandbox with fine-grained permissions

### Architecture
Wassette connects MCP clients (VS Code, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, etc.) to WebAssembly Components. For detailed architecture information, see `docs/design/architecture.md`.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Rust**: Latest stable version (nightly required for formatting)
- **Cargo**: Rust's package manager
- **Just**: Command runner for development tasks
- **mdbook**: For building documentation (optional)
- **Node.js**: For running MCP inspector (debugging)

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build in debug mode (default)
just build

# Build in release mode
just build release

# Build example components
just build-examples

# Clean build artifacts
just clean
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (automatically builds test components)
just test

# Clean test component artifacts
just clean-test-components

# Pre-build test components separately
just build-test-components
```

Tests include both unit tests and documentation tests. The test suite automatically builds required WebAssembly components before running.

## Code Style and Best Practices

### Rust Code Guidelines

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each function and struct should have a single, well-defined purpose
2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common logic into reusable functions or modules
3. **Descriptive Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for functions, variables, and types
4. **Unit Tests**: Include tests for all public functions and modules to verify correctness and handle edge cases
5. **Keep It Simple**: Avoid unnecessary complexity; favor straightforward solutions
6. **Dependency Management**: Use `Cargo.toml` carefully; avoid unnecessary dependencies
7. **Error Handling**: Use `anyhow` for error handling to provide context and stack traces
8. **Idiomatic Rust**: Write code that passes `cargo clippy` warnings
9. **Traits and Generics**: Use traits for shared behavior and generics for reusable, type-safe components
10. **Thread Safety**: Use stdlib primitives like `Arc` and `Mutex` for shared state
11. **Performance**: Choose appropriate data types like `&str` over `String` when appropriate

### Code Formatting

**ALWAYS** run the formatter before committing:

```bash
cargo +nightly fmt
```

### Linting

Run Clippy to catch common mistakes and non-idiomatic code:

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace
```

## Copyright Headers

**All Rust files (`.rs`) must include the Microsoft copyright header** at the top of the file.

### Required Format

```rust
// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
// Licensed under the MIT license.
```

The header should be at the very beginning of the file, followed by a blank line before any other content.

### Automated Application

Run the automated script to add headers to all relevant files:

```bash
./scripts/copyright.sh
```

This script is idempotent - it won't add duplicate headers if they already exist.

### Verification

Check if a file has the correct copyright header:

```bash
grep -q "Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation" your_file.rs
```

## Debugging

### Running the MCP Server

Start the Wassette MCP server for development and debugging:

```bash
# Start server with SSE transport (listens on 127.0.0.1:9001/sse)
just run

# Start with custom log level
just run RUST_LOG='debug'

# Run with example plugins
just run-filesystem
just run-get-weather  # Requires OPENWEATHER_API_KEY environment variable
just run-fetch-rs
```

### Using MCP Inspector

Connect to the running server using the MCP Inspector:

```bash
# Connect to remote MCP server (default SSE transport)
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli http://127.0.0.1:9001/sse

# List available tools
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli http://127.0.0.1:9001/sse --method tools/list

# Call a specific tool
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli http://127.0.0.1:9001/sse --method tools/call --tool-name remotetool --tool-arg param=value
```

## Documentation

### Building Documentation

The project uses [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) for documentation:

```bash
# Build documentation to docs/book/
just docs-build

# Serve with auto-reload at http://localhost:3000
just docs-watch

# Serve and open in browser
just docs-serve
```

Alternatively, use mdBook directly:

```bash
cd docs
mdbook serve        # Serve with live reload
mdbook build        # Build static HTML
```

### Documentation Structure

The documentation uses a multi-version setup:
- **Local development**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/overview.html`
- **Production**: `https://microsoft.github.io/wassette/latest/` or `/v0.3.0/` for releases

### Visual Documentation Changes

When making documentation changes that affect visual presentation:
- Use Playwright to capture before/after screenshots
- Include screenshots in progress reports
- This helps reviewers understand the visual impact

## Changelog Management

**All pull requests that change the codebase MUST update `CHANGELOG.md`** following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) principles.

### Change Categories

Add entries under the `[Unreleased]` section:
- **Added**: New features
- **Changed**: Changes in existing functionality
- **Deprecated**: Soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed**: Now removed features
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes
- **Security**: Vulnerability fixes

### Entry Format

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Support for new component loading feature ([#123](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/123))

### Fixed
- Issue with component lifecycle management ([#124](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/124))
```

### Important Notes

- **Always update the `[Unreleased]` section** - never modify existing version entries
- **Breaking changes** should be prefixed with `**BREAKING CHANGE**:`
- **Documentation-only changes** typically don't require changelog entries unless they significantly impact user experience
- Use present tense and be concise but descriptive
- Reference the Pull Request number
